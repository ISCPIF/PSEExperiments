OpenMOLE
========

[OpenMOLE](http://www.openmole.org) (Open MOdeL Experiment) is a workflow engine designed to leverage the computing power of distributed execution environments for naturally parallel processes.  
A process is told naturally parallel if the same computation runs many times for a set of different inputs, such as model experiment or data processing, ...  
OpenMOLE can be used as a desktop application and embedded in web applications.  
It is a free software distributed under the [AGPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html) free software license.  


## OpenMOLE Features: ##

  - **Expressive workflows** – Graphical and textual (**Domain Specific Language**) workflow system to describe naturally parallel processes,  
  - **Transparent distributed computing** – Zero-deployment (no installation step) approach to distribute the workload transparently on your multi-core machines, desktop-grids, clusters, grids, ...  
  - **Works with your programs** – Embed user’s executables (**Java, Binary exe, NetLogo, R, Scilab, Python, C++, ...**),  
  - **Scalable** – Handles millions of tasks and TB of data,  
  - **Model analysis** – Advanced numerical experiments on simulation models (design of experiments, stochastic model replication, calibration, sensitivity analysis, ...),  
  - **Mature** – Developed since 2008, used in many real world applications and for daily production by many scientists.
