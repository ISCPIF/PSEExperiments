@sect{An OpenMOLEÂ Hello World!}
  To demonstrate OpenMOLE console we will design a workflow that explore one variable multiplies it by 2 and then display each result. The computation is executed on multi-threaded environment.

  @br @hl.openmole(s"""
  $tasks

  // Define the execution environment, here it is a local execution environment with 4 threads but is can a remote cluster or a grid, it will work the same way with no installation step required on the execution environment.
  val env = LocalEnvironment(4)

  // Define and start the workflow
  val ex = exploration -< (model on env hook ToStringHook()) start
  """)

  @p If you want to distribute the exact same code on a remote cluster the only change you have to do is to switch the environment.

  @br @hl.openmole(s"""
  // All you need is an account on the cluster. You should also provide you authentication to OpenMOLE as explained in the documentation of each environment.
  val env = SLURMEnvironment("myLogin", "cluster.iscpif.fr")

  val ex = exploration -< (model on env hook ToStringHook()) start
  """, header = tasks)
